# Employee Insights Dashboard

## Overview
The Employee Insights Dashboard is a comprehensive project designed to manage, analyze, and visualize employee data. It combines a robust SQL database for data storage and querying with an interactive Power BI dashboard for data visualization and insights.

## Features
- **Database Management**: 
  - Create and manage an `employeee` database with detailed employee records.
  - Table schema includes fields such as employee ID, name, contact details, job information, salary, and department.

- **SQL Queries**:
  - Retrieve key employee data, such as first names, departments, and salary information.
  - Perform analytics on employee data through structured queries.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Visualize employee statistics with the Power BI report.
  - Gain insights into metrics like hiring trends, salary distribution, and departmental performance.

## File Structure
- `Project_3_SQL.sql`: Contains the SQL scripts for database creation, table setup, and sample queries.
- `PowerBI_Emp.pbix`: A Power BI file that presents visualizations and insights based on the employee dataset.

## Usage
1. Set up the SQL database:
   - Run the SQL scripts in `Project_3_SQL.sql` to create and populate the `employeee` database.
   
2. Load the Power BI dashboard:
   - Open the `PowerBI_Emp.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
   - Connect it to your database or data source to view interactive visualizations.

## Requirements
- SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Power BI Desktop
- Basic knowledge of SQL and data visualization
